## Hi there 👋
I’m a designer passionate about the intersection of spatial thinking, computation, technology, and architecture.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: architetcure, BIM workflow, projects that turn data into spatial experiences, from interactive maps to generative models.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: full-stack web development and how to better integrate AI into design workflows.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: creative coding, computational design tools, and data-driven spatial projects.  
- 💬 Ask me about: computational design, architectural workflows, or mapping data into new forms of storytelling.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [dai.yuxi1112@gmail.com](mailto:dai.yuxi1112@gmail.com)  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m growing an avocado hydroponically 🌱🥑
