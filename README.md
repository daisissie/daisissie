## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a designer passionate about the intersection of spatial thinking, computation, technology, and architecture.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: projects that turn data into spatial experiences, from interactive maps to generative models.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: full-stack web development and how to better integrate AI into design workflows.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: creative coding, computational design tools, and data-driven spatial projects.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: ways to make open data more accessible and spatially meaningful.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: computational design, architectural workflows, or mapping data into new forms of storytelling.
